The coding practices and homeworks of the course Introduction to Artificial Intelligence.

At homework-1, the goal was successfully implementing some search techniques for N-Puzzle problem. Used search techniques to solve N-Puzzle problem are as follows: Breadth first search, Depth first search, Uniform cost search and A* search (including heuristic). Also, N is equal to 8 in this assignment.

At homework-2, the goal was successfully implementing a genetic algorithm for Travelling Salesman problem which is an NP-Hard problem. The used function in the algorithm as follows: Evolve, crossover, mutate and tournament.

At homework-3, the goal was successfully implementing a machine learning algorithms such as KNearest Neighbour Classifier, Na√Øve Bayes Classifier and Decision Tree Classifier over the MINST dataset.
